**HOW TO PLAY:**
1.	Shoot balls with numbers into the circle.
2.	Donâ€™t let the ball you just shoot touches other balls. 
3.	Adjacent balls with the same numbers will merge
4.	Keep merging until it reaches 2048 or more.
5.	The key is to merge the balls to make space for new balls.
How the balls merge:
2 + 2 = 4, 4 + 4 = 8, 8 + 8 = 16, etc until 1024 + 1024 = 2048 or more.
